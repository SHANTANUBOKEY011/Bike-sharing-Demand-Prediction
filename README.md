# What I have Done in the Project.
       * Importing the Libraries
       * Read the Data
       * Getting information about data like how many null values in the data, how many features in the data, etc
       * Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset: Regression Plot, Boxplot, Barplot,etc
       * Skewness and outlier Handling
       * Checking Multicollinearity of data using Correlation matrix and VIF and dropping those columns who has high correlation and VIF
       * One hot encoding on categorical data
       * Splitting the data for Training and Testing the model
       * Standardising the Independent variable
       * Performing different model
       * Using LIME, getting the insights about the data that which features is impacting the data positively and negatively
